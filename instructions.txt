Instructions:

Hardware:
- probe gets put on middle pin of the mosfets
- 10v gets put from one end of the nearly 10k resistors
- refer to phone pictures for main pinouts (in general, 2-13 are used, white in
 high, farthest white gets 13)
- A0 gets pen pin
- ground using arduino

On start:
* sketch_sep29a gets loaded onto the arduino
 * make sure serial out is closed
* cd to laptop_code
* $ bash tmux_commands.sh
* in separate terminal, python3 term_state.py

On end:
* $ bash tmux_restore.sh
 * returns .bashrc to its original state


Completed improvements:
* Fully paramaterized number of chars per row

Potential improvements:
* Better communication:
 * Buffer appears to be 64 bytes. Less data sent may just solve the issue
 * If a way is found to send more data, do it in chunks of 64 with 
 acknowledgements?
* Refresh buffer periodically instead of only on update to write over misread

venv:
NOTE: ours is currently in .venv
To create a new virtual environment in a directory named env, run:
  python3 -m venv env

To activate this virtual environment (which modifies the PATH environment variable), run this:
  source env/bin/activate

Now you can install a library like requests in this virtual environment:
  pip install requests

The files will get installed under the env/ directory.

If you want to leave the virtual environment, you can run:
  deactivate
