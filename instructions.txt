Instructions:

Hardware:
- probe gets put on middle pin of the mosfets
- 10v gets put from one end of the nearly 10k resistors
- refer to phone pictures for main pinouts (in general, 2-13 are used, white in
 high, farthest white gets 13)
- A0 gets pen pin
- ground using arduino

On start:
* sketch_sep29a gets loaded onto the arduino
 * make sure serial out is closed
* cd to laptop_code
* $ bash tmux_commands.sh
* in separate terminal, python3 term_state.py

On end:
* $ bash tmux_restore.sh
 * returns .bashrc to its original state



Potential improvements:
* increased letter size
* recieving new letter times out
* sending data happens periodically instead of only on update
